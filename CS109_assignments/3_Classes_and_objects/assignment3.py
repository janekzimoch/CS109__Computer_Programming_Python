"""Assignment 3: Classes and objects

You will implement a set of classes that model a restaurant menu.

Feel free to add data, methods, and constructors to these classes as
needed, what I provide here is just a skeleton which also describes
the API you need to implement. As long as the API is implemented I
don't care if you add things to the classes to support the API. Just
make sure you actually need what you add.

NOTE: `raise NotImplementedError()` is a standard way to mark methods
that still need to be implemented. Remove it along with the TODOs
when you have implemented the methods.
