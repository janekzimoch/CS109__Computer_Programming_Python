# CS109__Computer_Programming_Python

### Course description:
Unit completed at UT Austin in 2018

* Programming language: 
  - **Python** 
* Unit length: 
  - **1 hour of lectures a week + assignments, for 1 semester**
* Grade received:
  - **A**



### List of assignments:
1. **Fibonacci** - Compute fib(n) in O(n) time using memoization and recursion.
2. **Files and Streaming Data** - Write code to read and process a large data file. In this case you will be generating complement of a DNA strand. The problem is that the DNA strand is very long (3 billion bases) so you cannot (or at least should not) load it all into memory at once.
3. **Classes and objects** - You will implement a set of classes that model a restaurant menu.
4. **Metaprogramming** - dynamic and functional features of Python and how they can be used to perform useful metaprogramming tasks to make other development tasks easier.
5. **Custom Container class** - Implement a class called TreeDict that supports operators the same way as a dict. This class should use binary search tree.
6. **Final Project: Markov Chain** - A Markov chain based random data generator, using graphs.
